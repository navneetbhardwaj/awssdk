[![Video Thumbnail](docs/video-thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxG7wvmelj0)

The Selling Partner API SDK for PHP enables you to easily connect your PHP application to Amazon's REST-based SP-API.

This SDK helps developers:
- Authenticate with Amazon's Selling Partner API (SP-API)
- Send and receive data using RESTful endpoints
- Manage Amazon marketplace operations programmatically

* [Learn more about SP-API](https://developer.amazonservices.com/)
* [API Documentation](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/)

### Getting started

#### Credentials

Before you can use the SDK, you need to be registered as a Selling Partner API developer. If you haven't done that yet, please follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/sp-api-registration-overview).
You also need to register your application to get valid credentials to call SP-API. If you haven't done that yet, please follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/registering-your-application).
If you are already registered successfully, you can find instructions on how to view your credentials in the [documentation](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/viewing-your-application-information-and-credentials).

## Installation & Usage

### Minimum Requirements

To run the SDK you need PHP 8.3 or higher.


### Installation
Install the SDK via Composer:
```command
composer require amzn-spapi/sdk
```
### Manual Installation
By using the download files, composer dependencies are already installed. You only need to include `autoload.php`:

```php
<?php
require_once('/path/to/OpenAPIClient-php/vendor/autoload.php');
```

### Use the SDK

In order to call one of the APIs included in the Selling Partner API, you need to:
* Configure credentials and marketplace ids. We provided a .env file to test the SDK in php/sdk/.env
* Create an instance for a specific API (e.g. Orders API)
* Call an operation

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

use SpApi\AuthAndAuth\LWAAuthorizationCredentials;
use SpApi\Configuration;
use SpApi\Api\orders\v0\OrdersV0Api;


// Set up LWA credentials
$lwaAuthorizationCredentials = new LWAAuthorizationCredentials([
"clientId" => "amzn1.application-**************",
"clientSecret" => "***********",
"refreshToken" => "***********",
"endpoint" => "https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token"
]);

//Initialize config
$config = new Configuration([], $lwaAuthorizationCredentials);

// Setting SP-API endpoint region
$config->setHost('https://sellingpartnerapi-na.amazon.com');

// Create a new HTTP client
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();

// Create an instance of the Orders Api
$api = new OrdersV0Api($config, $client);

try {
    // Call getOrders
    $result = $api->getOrders(
        $marketplace_ids = ['ATVPDKIKX0DER'],
        $created_after = '2025-01-01'
    );
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling OrderApi->getOrders: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

### Built-in rate limiter

The SDK comes with a built-in rate limiter. In case you hit a certain rate limit, calling an operation will throw `RateLimitExceededException`. Catch this exception and handle it appropriately.
By default, a standard rate limit configuration is applied. You can find the current rate limit configuration for each API on a dedicated page in the documention (e.g. for [Listings Items API](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/listings-items-api-rate-limits)).

It is possible to disable the built-in rate limiter by setting `rateLimiterEnabled` to `false` when instantiating a API instance:
```php
$api = new OrdersV0Api($config, $client, false);
```

It is also possible to override the default rate limit configuration. This has to be done after the API instance has been created and for each operation separately:
```php
$rateLimitConfiguration = [
    'id' => 'spApi',
    'policy' => 'token_bucket',
    'limit' => 5, // capacity of bucket
    'rate' => [ // refill rate
        'interval' => '1 second',
        'amount' => 50
    ],
];

$factory = new RateLimiterFactory($rateLimitConfiguration, new InMemoryStorage());
$api->getOrderRateLimiter = $factory->create("<insert-unique-id>"); // Use unique id in create-method
```
